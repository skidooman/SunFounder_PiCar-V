To build and install snap 
On an ARM64 machine
  mkdir core-car
  cd core-car
  mkdir snap
  cp <path to cloned snapcraft.yaml> snap/.
  cd ..
  sudo snapcraft --destructive-mode --verbosity=verbose

  Transfer the .snap file to your Raspberry Pi. Instructions are valid for Ubuntu core 20
  sudo snap install <name of .snap file>

  Then connect the interfaces as follows:
  Interface            Plug                          Slot                  Notes
camera               core-car:camera               :camera               manual
gpio-memory-control  core-car:gpio-memory-control  :gpio-memory-control  manual
home                 core-car:home                 :home                 manual
i2c                  core-car:i2c                  pi:i2c-0              manual
i2c                  core-car:i2c                  pi:i2c-1              manual
network              core-car:network              :network              -
network-bind         core-car:network-bind         :network-bind         -

  Once you are done, restart the snap and you should be all set. 
  If not executing in daemon mode, keep in mind that starting the server requires sudo.
